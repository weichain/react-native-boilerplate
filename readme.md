# React Native Boilerplate

## Introduction

This React Native boilerplate project serves as a solid foundation for kickstarting new projects at our company. It's built with a specific set of technologies and principles to enhance development efficiency and maintainability.

## Key Technologies

### 1. Zustand for State Management

We leverage Zustand for managing the application's state. It offers a simple and efficient way to handle state within your components.

### 2. React-Query for API Communication and Caching

React-Query is our go-to tool for interacting with APIs, caching, and handling server state. It simplifies data fetching and caching, making your app responsive and performant.

### 3. Expo for Rapid Development

Expo is a valuable tool for speeding up the development process. It provides a wide range of pre-built components and features, allowing us to focus on business logic.

### 4. Tamagui for UI

Tamagui is our choice for UI components. It's designed for React Native, offering a consistent and visually appealing UI for your applications.
